# Predisigned Blog
This is a Blog that I predisigned with adobe xd just to practice. Also i tried to apply the BEM methodology on the styles of this blog.

This is a simple structure of a Blog, I tried to apply the BEM methodology on the styles. You just clone the repositoy and open 
the index file, to see the styles, are in the css directory and all the images that i used are in the images directory.
The last thing is that i put also the design of the blog that i did in adobe xd to compare with the final version.

Thanks for watching.
